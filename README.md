# Reading Notes

This is my notebook for the Code Fellows. It contains my:

* class notes
* questions
* assignment information.

My name is **Dan Brian** (_he/him_) and I’m located in New Hampshire (timezone is EST).

I have been working in tech as a technical writer for almost a decade, and I’m currently working for **DigitalOcean** documenting APIs, Terraform, and other cloud infrastructure stuff. Most of my coding experience comes from developing and documenting small cloud solutions.

I’m really excited to push my coding knowledge to the next level and start to actually write and implement full web applications (and then document the heck out of them).
